          Getting your first apartment is exciting. It’s freedom, independence, and a place that’s finally yours.
          But it’s also one of the biggest financial transitions you’ll make—and the costs don’t stop at rent.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little planning now can help your first place feel empowering instead of stressful.

        <h2>Rent Is Only the Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          When you see a rent number that fits your budget, it’s tempting to stop there. Don’t.
          Most first apartments come with additional costs that add up quickly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilities (electric, gas, water, trash)</li>
          <li>Internet and streaming</li>
          <li>Renter’s insurance</li>
          <li>Parking fees</li>
          <li>Laundry costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Before signing anything, ask what’s included—and what isn’t.
          A slightly higher rent with utilities included can sometimes be the better deal.
        </p>

        <h2>Read the Lease (Especially the Fine Print)</h2>

        <div class="media-block media-block--left">
          <figure class="story-figure" aria-label="Lease illustration">

          <div>
            <p>
              Your lease isn’t just paperwork—it’s a contract that affects your flexibility and your finances.
            </p>
            <p>Pay close attention to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lease length:</strong> Are you signing for 6 months, 12 months, or longer?</li>
              <li><strong>Renewal terms:</strong> Does it auto-renew if you don’t give notice?</li>
              <li><strong>Early exit rules:</strong> What happens if you need to move before the lease ends?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Many first-time renters are surprised to learn they must give 30, 60, or even 90 days’ notice before moving out.
          Missing that window can mean paying extra rent—or losing your deposit.

        <h2>Deposits, Fees, and Move-In Costs</h2>

        <div class="media-block">
          <div>
            <p>Your first month’s rent is rarely the full upfront cost. Be prepared for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Security deposits</li>
              <li>Application or admin fees</li>
              <li>Pet deposits or monthly pet rent</li>
              <li>Move-in fees charged by the building</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These costs can easily equal <strong>one to two months of rent</strong> before you’ve even unpacked a box.
            </p>
          </div>

      <section aria-label="Close neighbors shared walls">
        <h2>Close Neighbors, Shared Walls, Real Life</h2>
        <p>Apartment living is different from having your own place. Shared walls mean:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Noise travels—both ways</li>
          <li>Quiet hours matter</li>
          <li>You may hear neighbors, and they may hear you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If possible, visit the apartment at different times of day. What feels peaceful at noon can sound very different at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t a dealbreaker—it’s just part of apartment life. Budgeting for things like rugs, headphones, or
          white-noise machines can make a big difference.

          <div>
            <p>
              Not everything about apartment living is a compromise. Many buildings include amenities that can save you money:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A shared gym may eliminate a fitness membership</li>
              <li>A pool or common space can replace entertainment spending</li>
              <li>Package rooms, maintenance services, or security features can reduce stress</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When budgeting, consider what the apartment <em>replaces</em>—not just what it costs.

      <section aria-label="Furnishing without overdoing it">
        <h2>Furnishing Without Overdoing It</h2>
        <p>You don’t need to fully furnish your apartment on day one. Start with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A place to sleep</li>
          <li>A place to sit</li>
          <li>A place to eat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Everything else can come over time. Thrift stores, marketplace apps, and hand-me-downs can stretch your budget without sacrificing comfort.

        <h2>A First Apartment Is a Learning Experience</h2>
        <p>Your first apartment doesn’t have to be perfect. It just needs to work.</p>
        <p>Budgeting for it means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding your commitments</li>
          <li>Planning for real-life costs</li>
          <li>Leaving yourself enough breathing room to enjoy the experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With a little preparation, your first place can feel exciting, stable, and manageable—exactly what it should be.
