        <h1>Getting Started: How to Use These Calculators</h1>

        <p class="story-intro">
          New to budgeting or loan calculations? This short guide will help you
          understand how to use the calculators on this site and how to apply the
          results to your real-world financial decisions.

          <h2>1. Start with Your Monthly Take-Home Income</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Smart Budget Percentages</strong> calculator helps you see
            how a typical American household allocates their spending across major
            categories like housing, food, transportation, and savings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter your monthly take-home income and compare where you stand. If
            one category is higher than the recommended target percentage, consider
            whether small adjustments might help over the next few months.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Understand Your Loans More Clearly</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Missing Loan Term</strong> calculator helps you determine
            one missing value—principal, payment amount, interest rate, or number
            of payments—when you already know the other three.
          </p>
          <p>
            This calculator is especially useful when you're comparing refinance
            offers, planning an early payoff, or evaluating how extra monthly
            payments impact your timeline.

          <h2>3. Use Both Tools Together</h2>
          <p>
            Many people use these calculators together: the budget calculator helps
            you understand where your money is going each month, and the loan
            calculator helps you plan the most efficient way to eliminate debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            A realistic view of your spending combined with a clear understanding
            of your loans gives you a powerful starting point for building a
            stable financial plan.

          <h2>4. Adjust Gradually</h2>
          <p>
            Budgeting works best when changes are small, intentional, and
            sustainable. These tools are designed to help you make simple
            improvements—not drastic overnight changes.
