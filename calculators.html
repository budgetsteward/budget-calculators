              Enter your monthly take-home income to see how a typical household
              might allocate spending across major categories, then compare that to
              a budget-conscious target plan. Use it to spot where your budget may
              be out of balance.

              number of payments, or payment amount—and this calculator will
              estimate the missing one using standard amortization formulas.
