              Enter your monthly take-home income to see how a typical
              household might allocate spending across major categories, then
              compare that to a budget-conscious target plan. Use it to spot
              where your budget may be out of balance.

              Know any three of your loan’s values—principal, interest rate,
              number of payments, or payment amount—and this calculator will
              estimate the missing one using standard amortization formulas.
              Helpful for understanding payoff options and “what if” scenarios.
